                         <p>
                             Once upon a time... Facebook told me that a friend had passed away. My friend had been suffering from an agressive cancer for several years so the news wasn't fully unexpected but still a shock.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Over the next few days my friend's "wall" turned into a digital memorial.</br> 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             First, the hours to say a final farewell, later a collage of photos of his life together with a text he had chosen before and finally a thank you for all the well-wishers appeared over several days.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Even though or maybe especially because I was outside of the country at that time the whole "ritual" really touched me. People who had studied with him abroad, old work colleagues, high school friends...
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             We all left comments/ condolences and achieved closure in a way...

            <p>
                We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. To the fullest extent permitted by law, isolace and its affiliates, suppliers and distributors make no warranties, either express or implied, about the services. The services are provided "AS IS." we also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Some places don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

            <h5><span>1.9 Limitation of Liability</span></h5>
            <p>
                We don't exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so—this includes any liability for iSolace's or its affiliates' fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation in providing the services. In countries where the following types of exclusions aren't allowed, we're responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn't affect consumer rights that can't be waived or limited by any contract or agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, iSolace, its affiliates, suppliers or distributors won't be liable for: 
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages, or
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) any loss of use, data, business, or profits, regardless of legal theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                These exclusions or limitations will apply regardless of whether or not iSolace or any of its affiliates has been warned of the possibility of such damages. If you use the services for any commercial, business or resale purpose, iSolace, its affiliates, suppliers or distributors will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity. iSolace and its affiliates aren't responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any user of the services.

These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
            </p>
            <h5><span>1.11 Waiver, Severability & Assignment</span></h5>
            <p>
                iSolace's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
            </p>
